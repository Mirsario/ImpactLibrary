A library mod which adds collision surfaces, allowing one to make custom movable and rotatable platforms and walls which collide with the player independantly from tiles.

 Collision Surfaces are orientable "wall" objects which have their positions determined by two end points. 
 To use collision surfaces, they must be defined and updated from another class which is updated ingame, such as an NPC or Projectile.

 This mod can be used either as a StrongReference dependency or incorporated into the mod's source code directly. If you plan on taking the direct implementation appoach, I (Seraph) the mod author must be credited somewhere.

 You can find further instructions on the implementation of collision surfaces on the forum page, or by extracting the mod, which contains an example cube platform NPC.
